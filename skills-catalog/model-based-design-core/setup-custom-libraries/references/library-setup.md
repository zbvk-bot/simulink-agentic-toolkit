# Library Reuse & Block Policy

Custom library blocks take priority over building equivalent logic from primitives. This reference covers the three prerequisite gates and how to use library blocks once configured.

## Save Locations

| What | Where | How to get path |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| `satk-libraries.json` (library declarations) | `prefdir` (default) or project root | `prefdir()` |
| `.satk/block-policy.json` | Same directory as libraries file | — |
| `.satk/library-kg/` (Knowledge Index) | Same directory as libraries file | — |

Paths saved to prefdir must be absolute. Project-level paths can be relative.

The presence of `satk-libraries.json` is the signal that custom libraries are configured.

## Gate 1: Library Config

If no library config exists and the user explicitly asks to set up custom libraries, ask for their reusable Simulink block libraries. They can provide either a **folder path** (containing `.slx` files) or **specific `.slx` file paths**. Do not continue until the user responds.

If a folder is provided, save each `.slx` file as a separate library entry.

**User provides libraries:**

```matlab
dataRoot = prefdir();
libraries(1).name = 'MotorLib';
libraries(1).path = 'D:\SharedLibs\MotorLib.slx';
libraries(1).description = 'Motor control blocks';
library.LibraryConfig.save(dataRoot, libraries);
```

**User says "none":**

Do not create any files. The agent will proceed with standard Simulink blocks.

**Project-specific override (self-contained):**

```matlab
projectRoot = '/path/to/project';
library.LibraryConfig.save(projectRoot, libraries);
```

**Promote project config to prefdir:**

```matlab
sourceRoot = '/path/to/project';
dataRoot = prefdir();

sourceSATK = fullfile(sourceRoot, '.satk');
destSATK = fullfile(dataRoot, '.satk');
if isfolder(destSATK)
    rmdir(destSATK, 's');
end
copyfile(sourceSATK, destSATK);
```

## Gate 2: Block Policy

If libraries are declared and `.satk/block-policy.json` does not exist, ask the user whether to configure a policy.

- **Yes** — load the `configuring-block-policy` skill.
- **No / skip** — save defaults (prefer custom libraries over built-in), so the question isn't asked again. Always create this file via the API; never write it manually.

```matlab
policyData = library.BlockPolicy.defaults();
library.BlockPolicy.save(dataRoot, policyData);
```

If `.satk/block-policy.json` already exists, proceed directly.

Policy must be configured before the Knowledge Index.

## Gate 3: Library Blocks Knowledge Index

If libraries are declared and the Knowledge Index is empty (`.satk/library-kg/index.md` contains `populated: false`) or missing, provide the user with options to index their library blocks and wait until the user responds:

- **Automatic** — load the `curating-library-kg` skill. The agent reads `.satk/library-cache/*.json`, infers categories and descriptions from block metadata, saves curation to `.satk/library-curation.json`, and generates the Knowledge Graph — all without asking the user for input. Present the results to the user for review after generation.
- **Guided setup** — load the `curating-library-kg` skill and follow its interactive workflow (common blocks, categories, descriptions). The skill collects curation data with user input at each step, saves it to `.satk/library-curation.json`, and generates the Knowledge Graph. Do NOT proceed until the curation workflow completes.

Both paths use the `curating-library-kg` skill. The difference is whether the agent proposes and commits autonomously (automatic) or pauses for user confirmation at each step (guided).

Do not use `find_system`, `load_system`, or `get_param` on library `.slx` files to build or populate the index.

If the Knowledge Index generation produces zero blocks, inform the user and ask for the **folder path** containing all `.slx` sub-library files. Update `satk-libraries.json` with the discovered files and regenerate.

The index is cached — it only regenerates when the library `.slx` or block policy changes. Skip this gate if `.satk/library-kg/index.md` already exists and does NOT contain the `populated: false` marker.

## Status Display (Management Menu)

When all gates are satisfied (`gatePass: true, found: true`), display current configuration status before offering menu options.

**Retrieve status data:**

```matlab
% 1. Library names and paths (from settingsLookup dataRoot)
config = library.LibraryConfig.load(dataRoot);
% config.libraries(i).name, .path, .description
numLibraries = numel(config.libraries);

% 2. Policy mode and fallback
policyData = library.BlockPolicy.loadRaw(dataRoot, config);
% policyData.policyMode — 'prefer_customer_libraries' | 'approved_blocks_only'
% policyData.fallbackToBuiltins — logical

% 3. KG block count — read index.md header
kgIndexPath = fullfile(dataRoot, '.satk', 'library-kg', 'index.md');
kgContent = fileread(kgIndexPath);
% Parse block_count and category_count from YAML front-matter
```

## Using Library Blocks

Before your first `model_edit` call in a session, read the Knowledge Index:

1. `.satk/library-kg/index.md` — library overview, policy mode, commonly used blocks
2. `.satk/library-kg/common.md` — top blocks with intent descriptions
3. Category pages (e.g., `.satk/library-kg/control.md`) — all blocks in a domain with intent

Use the exact block name from the Knowledge graph in the `type` field of `add_block`. Do not invent names not listed in the Knowledge graph. If no library block fits, fall back to built-in Simulink blocks.

## Block Policy Rules

The `policyMode` in `.satk/block-policy.json` is the source for fallback behavior:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `approved_blocks_only` | Only use blocks in the Knowledge graph. If nothing fits, ask the user. |
| `prefer_customer_libraries` | Prefer library blocks, fall back to built-ins when no match. |

- **Off-limits parameters** (protected in block policy) — the agent will not modify these values.
- **Excluded blocks** — removed from the Knowledge graph entirely; the agent will never place them.
