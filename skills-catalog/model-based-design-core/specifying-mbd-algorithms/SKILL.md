# MBD Algorithm Specs

Structured specification of algorithms for Model-Based Design. Adapts the `specifying-software` templates for the MBD algorithm domain.

## When to Use

- Specifying a controller, estimator, signal processor, diagnostic, or supervisory logic algorithm
- The algorithm will be authored in Simulink, Stateflow, System Composer, or as a MATLAB Function block
- The algorithm is part of a model-based design workflow (simulation, code generation, or both)
- Creating, updating, or reviewing algorithm specification documents

## When NOT to Use

- **Building** the algorithm model → use `building-simulink-models`
- **Testing** an existing model → use `testing-simulink-models`
- **Plant/environment models** → use `specifying-plant-models`
- **Traditional software** (C, C++, Python, standalone MATLAB scripts) → use `specifying-software`
- **Full closed-loop system** → use this skill for the algorithm side, `specifying-plant-models` for the plant side

## Output Conventions

Store specs per algorithm. **Prefix every filename with the algorithm name:**

```
docs/specs/algorithms/<algorithm-name>/
├── <algorithm-name>-system.md
├── <algorithm-name>-architecture.md
├── <algorithm-name>-implementation-plan.md
└── <algorithm-name>-test-plan.md
```

## Mode Selection

> Is this a single-function algorithm with <3 operating modes, single-rate, and will be built by one person/agent?
> - **Yes** → Quick spec: 2 documents (system+architecture combined, implementation+test combined)
> - **No** → Full spec: 4 separate documents

## Workflow

### Step 1: Establish External Interface

Identify what this algorithm connects to. If an existing system exists, read it with `model_overview` and `model_read`. If greenfield, define the boundary from requirements.

Classify every signal crossing the algorithm boundary:
- **Inputs**: measurements, commands, bus signals from other subsystems
- **Outputs**: actuator commands, processed signals, status/diagnostic flags
- **Parameters**: tunable (calibratable) vs. fixed (design-time)

### Step 2: Define Algorithm Objectives

Establish what the algorithm must achieve — tracking performance, bandwidth, disturbance rejection, detection thresholds, processing latency, etc. These are the acceptance criteria that drive architecture decisions and test plan design.

### Step 3: Domain Verification *(if equations, standards, or domain conventions are referenced)*

Use `web_search` to confirm key equations, standards, or conventions referenced in the spec. Record confirmed sources in Appendix B: Research Notes.

Skip when: algorithm is purely logic-based, domain is well-known, or no equations are involved.

### Step 4: Write System Spec

Template: `assets/system-spec-template.md`

**Review gate** before proceeding — verify:
- Clear algorithm objectives with quantitative acceptance criteria
- Complete external interface contract (all inputs, outputs, parameters with units and sign conventions)
- Operating mode completeness — are all modes defined, including startup, fault, and degraded?
- Actuator/effector mapping correctness — which output drives which actuator, and is the sign correct?
- Boundary behavior — what happens at saturation, zero-crossing, enable/disable thresholds?

### Step 5: Write Architecture Spec

Template: `assets/architecture-spec-template.md`

**Review gate** before finalizing — verify:
- Dimensional consistency — units match across all interfaces end-to-end
- Feedback polarity — negative feedback for stabilizing loops, correct sign through the entire loop
- Anti-windup and reset behavior specified for every integrator
- Mode transition logic — bumpless transfer, initialization on mode entry, no unguarded transitions
- Rate transitions — multi-rate interfaces handled correctly
- Saturation and limiting at actuator outputs and per-channel levels
- Algebraic loops — every feedback path has an explicit delay element with documented IC and DFT status annotated in the Component Catalog
- Code generation constraints addressed (data types, scheduling, memory) if applicable

**Required:** API Verification for any API, function, or block behavior not already used in neighboring code. Test actual signatures and behavior using `evaluate_matlab_code`, `web_search`, or existing codebase usage. Record in Appendix B of the architecture spec.

### Step 6: Write Implementation Plan + Test Plan

Templates: `assets/implementation-plan-template.md`, `assets/test-plan-template.md`

**Review gate — Implementation Plan** — verify:
- Phase 0 interface freeze gates all parallel work
- Build order respects data flow dependencies (leaf components first)
- Tightly coupled components assigned to same agent or coordinated
- Each checkpoint has concrete verification steps (model_read, model_query_params, test)
- Parameter table complete with sources

**Review gate — Test Plan** — verify:
- Staged validation: component MIL → integrated MIL → system-in-loop MIL → robustness → SIL/PIL (if code-generated)
- Every operating mode tested, including startup and fault
- Mode transition scenarios with bumpless transfer checks
- Saturation and anti-windup recovery tests
- Quantitative acceptance criteria with design basis for each test
- Input signal definitions reusable across stages

Get user approval before implementation begins.

### Updating Existing Specs

When updating specs: check affected sections, update them, update "Last Updated" date, review for consistency with other specs.

## Guardrails

### Always
- Verify feedback polarity before finalizing any control loop architecture
- Verify units and sign conventions end-to-end across all interfaces
- Freeze interfaces (Phase 0) before parallel subsystem work begins

### Ask First
- Adding operating modes not in the system spec
- Changing interface signals after Phase 0 freeze
- Deviating from the plant's or system's sample time alignment

### Never
- Implement control without specifying anti-windup / saturation behavior for integrators
- Hardcode tuning parameters that should be calibratable
- Skip mode transition specification for multi-mode algorithms
- Break an algebraic loop with a Memory block in a continuous-time path (use Unit Delay for discrete, Transfer Fcn with small time constant for continuous)

## Spec Types

For guidance on when to create optional specs (detailed spec, component spec), see `references/spec-types.md`. Create a detailed spec when architecture is blocked by: control law definition, state machine definition, or interface contract.
